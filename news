I am cancelling my involvement of this repository.
I will upload my unfinished crap.

I am working on getting the following games 
working:

	Quake (on QuakeSpasm)
		All I need to do is get the engine to recognize the gamefiles.
	Xonotic 
		I have to append an installation script for glibc. Ehuhduhfuhuhsdufhsuhdfu hfghsdfgsfhgbsifghkixfdgidhgidifhgshfgluhgi
	Some text-based games
		I can get a bunch working, but I want to have a bunch in one script.
